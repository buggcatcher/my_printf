# I want to make this program behave similarly to the classic printf. I'm having trouble making the outputs the same for both ./a.out and ./a.out | cat -e.

At first, when running ./a.out, the terminal displays the expected result. My ft_printf matches the output of the classic printf.
Then, when piping ./a.out | cat -e, something weird happens.

I would like to understand the reason for such behavior.


Here's a photo with the classical printf commented.
